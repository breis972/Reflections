What happens when you initialize a repository?  Why do you need to do it?

One thing that happens is that the .git/ directory is created.
This directory is where the metadata about the git repository will be stored.
Until you initialize, you will not be able to commit files/programs.


How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?  What value do you think it offers?

The staging area is kind of a holding place between the working directory and the repository.
It allows the use the flexibility to control which files are committed and when.
This power further helps to isolate commits to one logical change.

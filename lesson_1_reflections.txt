             Git and Git Hub  Lesson 1 Reflections

How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you to see the bug that was introduced?

The output showed only what differed between the files, what was added or deleted.
This let me focus in quickly on what could have caused the bug.  
Very useful for large files/programs.  Much more efficient than manually.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?

You could make series of changes and later put them under test.
You would always have a way of getting back to working code, 
and you could find which version introduced a bug.
You would have freedom to "try things" without fear of breaking code.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit vs having it automatically saved?

Pro - you can control the commit point to make logical sense.
	- avoids auto saving at a point that won't even compile
Con - user must have good habits or can lose a LOT of code work.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

I suspect that Git anticipates the interelated execution of multiple files to create apps and programs.
Google docs is anticipating standalone files only.
